From the very first notes, it’s clear that Emily, Colin,  and the rest of the band have crafted something special. The song pulses with the same raw energy, the same emotional intensity that made us fall in love with Linkin Park years ago. The guitars snarl, the drums thunder, and the lyrics cut deep.
