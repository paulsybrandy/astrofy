So, hello, and welcome (again) to the new location of my blog. I know that there is a little doubt there as this has happened a couple times now but I promise you, this is the last time a location change will happen. 

There has been quite a bit of changes going on as far as my new site which I wanted to design using Astro. However, I then started thinking about my portfolio and other related sites and how much more uniform everything would be if I redesigned them as well to match. In the end, I decided to redesign all other pages as well. It'll look so much better, I figured.

So... yeah... welcome to the new (and permanent) location of my blog. I will be porting over the last few blog posts here as well. They will arrive soon. Thanks for your patience!
